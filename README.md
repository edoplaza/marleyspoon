# Marley Spoon Technical Excercise

This is a simple excercise which follows this list of requirements:

### Implementation requirements:
- Create a sample web application that uses the Contentful API to fetch data
- The application MUST be coded in React + Typescript
- SSR with Next.js
- There should be 2 views (different URL path for each one):
        A list view of all the recipes
        A detail view of a recipe
- When clicking on a recipe on the list view, you should then show the detailed view
- IMPORTANT: The application should be as production-ready as possible (consider scalability, modularity, quality, etc. as you normally do in your projects), but no deployment is needed

### Implementation bonuses (not mandatory):
- Styled components
- GraphQL

### Modules used in this project:

- create-next-app + typescript
- contentful
- emotion
- polished
- Content Delivery API

### Build instructions:

- Clone repository
- yarn dev / yarn build / yarn start
- The .env.local file is exceptionally available on this repo so it can be tested locally
